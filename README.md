# C++ HTTP Server

This HTTP server is written in c++ using sockets library.
For now, it supports GET requests only.

## Project organization

This project is organized into the following directories:

- simple http server
- dynamic http server (TODO)

### Simple http server

This folder contains a simpler implementation in which all the files requested are stored in persistent storage.

### Dynamic http server

This folder contains a more complex implementation of the http server, in which content is dynamically generated depending on the request.
